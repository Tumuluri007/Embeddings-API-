**OpenAI Embeddings API Implementation**
This repository demonstrates the practical application of **OpenAI's Embeddings API**, showcasing how to generate and compare embedding vectors for textual data. The project utilizes the text-embedding-ada-002 model to create high-dimensional vector representations of words and phrases, enabling semantic similarity comparisons.
**Key Features:**
Custom Embedding Generation: Users can input any string to generate its corresponding embedding vector.
Multiple Input Handling: The script can process multiple inputs simultaneously, generating embedding vectors for each.
Similarity Scoring: Implements cosine similarity calculation using numpy's dot product to quantify the semantic relationship between different embeddings.
Comparative Analysis: Demonstrates the similarity scores between semantically related and unrelated concepts.
**Technical Details:**
API: OpenAI's Embeddings API
Model: text-embedding-ada-002
Language: Python
Libraries: numpy, openai
**Use Cases:**
This implementation can be extended for various NLP tasks, including:
Semantic search
Content recommendation systems
Text classification
Anomaly detection in textual data
**Code Highlights:**
Efficient API calls using the OpenAI client
Vector similarity calculation using numpy
Interactive user input for custom embedding generation
Comparative analysis of different word pairs to demonstrate embedding effectiveness
**Important Notes:**
Requires an OpenAI API key (not included in the repository for security reasons)
The similarity scores are based on the cosine similarity of the embedding vectors
The text-embedding-ada-002 model produces 1536-dimensional embedding vectors
This project serves as a starting point for developers interested in leveraging OpenAI's embedding technology for advanced NLP applications. It provides a clear demonstration of how to interact with the API, process the results, and perform basic similarity analyses.
